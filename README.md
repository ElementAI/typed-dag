Code for "Typing assumptions improve identification in causal discovery" presented at The Neglected Assumptions in Causal Inference workshop at ICML 2021. 

This code perform the experiments of Section 7 where the size of the MEC is compared to the size of the t-MEC. \
To launch the experiments:
`python main.py` \
To make boxplots from the data:
`python utils.py`
